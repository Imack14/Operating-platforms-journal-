Draw It or Lose It – Software Design Document Submission
Portfolio Artifact Submission and Reflection
For this project, my client was The Gaming Room, a company that originally launched a successful Android app called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to expand the game into a web-based, cross-platform version that would work across desktops, mobile devices, and different operating systems. My role was to design a scalable, secure, and efficient software architecture that would allow multiplayer functionality, prevent game duplication, and ensure great performance across all platforms.

One thing I think I did particularly well was structuring the design around clear patterns like Singleton for the game service and Iterator for managing players and teams. This made the documentation clean and easy to follow, especially for future developers who might pick up the project. I also made sure to deeply think through storage, memory management, and security, which felt like an important step in not just delivering what the client asked for, but making it future-proof too.

Working through the software design document before jumping into any coding helped me a lot. It forced me to break the problem down at a high level, find weak spots early, and set up clear goals. It made the idea of coding the application less overwhelming because I already had a strong blueprint to follow. This step-by-step approach saved time and reduced confusion.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would probably refine the Domain Model diagram. It was good overall, but I think I could make the relationships and entity interactions even more detailed. Maybe adding more specific methods and showing service interaction points would make it even stronger and more developer-friendly.

When it came to understanding the user’s needs, I made sure to focus on scalability, simplicity, and security because those were heavily implied by the client's request to move to a broad, distributed web environment. I constantly asked myself, "If I were a user, would this experience be fast, seamless, and trustworthy?" It's critical to design with the user at the center because no matter how technically sound the backend is, a poor user experience can sink the project.

In designing the software, I leaned on object-oriented principles, design patterns, and a strategy of modular, distributed architecture. If I were to tackle a similar project in the future, I would definitely start again by mapping out design patterns first, then move into distributed system planning with a strong focus on security, load balancing, and cross-platform UI considerations. I'd also work more closely with potential users to gather feedback even earlier.

Overall, this project really reinforced how powerful a well-thought-out design document can be in setting the tone for an entire software development project.
